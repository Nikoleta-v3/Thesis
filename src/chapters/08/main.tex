\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chapter:conclusion}

This Chapter serves to summarise the work and contributions of this thesis. Each
chapter contains a detailed chapter summary section, and so the summary here will be
brief.

\section{Research Summary}

Chapter~\ref{chapter:introduction} introduced the particular strategic game
which has been the fundamental focus of this thesis, the Iterated Prisoner's
Dilemma, carried out an initial literature review and outlined the research
tasks of this thesis.

Whilst reviewing the extensive literature on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma an
interesting research question was raised, namely the question of what are the
research topics of the field. The research topics were determined using two
separate approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In Chapter~\ref{chapter:literature_review} whilst conducting a
    condensed literature review it became clear how several of the reviewed
    manuscripts fitted under research topics. These research topics were
    determined manually by inspecting the manuscripts individually. Namely, the
    research topics determined by this approach have been evolutionary dynamics,
    intelligently designed strategies, structured strategies and training and
    software that has been developed specifically for the game.
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:bibliometric_study} collected a data set of articles
    metadata on the Iterate Prisoner's Dilemma and used a topic modelling technique
    to automatically determine five topics from the articles' abstracts.
    These five topics were human
    subject research, biological studies, strategies, evolutionary dynamics on
    networks and modelling problems as a Prisoner's Dilemma.
\end{itemize}

The research of Chapter~\ref{chapter:bibliometric_study} resulted in a bespoke
research software tool called Arcas which has been used by other researchers,
and the bespoke data set of articles resulted in a further research question.
This was whether the academic field of the Prisoner’s Dilemma is cooperative and
whether there is influence between the authors.

It was deduced that the field of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is a
collaborative field and authors are likely to write with a collaborator's
co-authors whilst on average having 4 co-authors. The field is not
necessarily more collaborative than other fields, as many authors authors just
tend to collaborate with authors from one community but not many authors are
involved in multiple communities. Exploring the influence of authors based on
their publications concluded that authors do not gain much influence, and the
authors with influence are only the ones connected to a ``main'' group of
authors.

The fundamental research question of this thesis is the same question which has
troubled researchers since the formulation of the game, namely what is the
optimal behaviour an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma strategy should adapt as a
response to different environments.
Chapters~\ref{chapter:meta_tournaments},~\ref{chapter:memory_one},
and~\ref{chapter:lstm} reinforce and disprove well established results on optimal
behaviour by
exploring new mathematical and computing avenues, and moreover, they have introduced
crucial properties that drive and explain the success of strategies across all
tournament types.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:meta_tournaments} examined a collection of
    \numberofstrategies strategies, and deduced that there was not a single
    strategy that performs well in diverse Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma
    scenarios. Nevertheless, the Chapter established that there are several
    properties that heavily influence the best performing strategies in the game
    and these are: be nice, be provocable and contrite, be a little envious, be
    clever, and adapt to the environment, which includes the parameters of the
    tournament (e.g. noise) and the population of opponents.
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:memory_one} investigated best response memory-one
    strategies with a theory of mind. The results add to the 
    literature that has shown that extortionate play is not always optimal by
    showing that optimal play is often not extortionate. Moreover, it provided
    evidence that memory-one strategies suffer from their limited memory in
    multi agent interactions and can be out performed by optimised strategies
    with longer memory.
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:lstm} %TODO include results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributions}

This thesis has made novel contributions across various themes. Initially, numerous
research software packages have been implemented as part of this thesis. These
packages have been written following the highest standards of software
development, and have been made available so that other researchers can
contribute to and use them. The packages include Arcas a tool designed for
scraping academic articles from various APIs and
\mintinline{python}{sequences-sensei} a project for performing genetic
algorithms. Additionally, software contributions were made to well established
Python libraries such as SymPy~\cite{sympy} and Axelrod-Python
library~\cite{axelrodproject}.

A total of six accompanying data sets have been generated as a result of this
work. These have been achieved and made available via Zenodo, and likewise, are
available to other researchers. They can be use to conduct further analysis and
provide new insights to the field. These data sets include one of the largest
collection of Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments known to the field.

Designing new strategies is an important type of research for the field.
This thesis has introduced an abundant number of properties of successful
strategies which can be of interest to researchers designing a new strategy
for new environments, or just to understand the reasons behind some strategies
being better than others. Complementing this, a new mathematical framework has
been developed for the better understanding of memory-one strategies and an
early attempt of using recurrent neural networks to train Iterate Prisoner's
Dilemma strategies has been presented which researchers can improve on.

Finally, it has contributed to the continuous understanding of the emergence of
cooperation by providing a condition for which cooperation can not occur in
memory-one environments, and it has proven that constrained quadratic
ratio optimisation problems that are non concave can be solved explicitly by
using resultant theory.

\section{Complementary Research}

The results of this thesis are not the only scientific results produced
during the course of this doctoral research.

Two further undertaken projects which likewise focused on the Iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma have been
\cite{Knight2017, Harper2017}. The works of~\cite{Knight2017, Harper2017}
focused on the usage of reinforcement learning algorithms (genetic algorithms
and particle swarm optimisation algorithms) in training a series of strategies
based on different structures such as finite state machines, hidden Markov
models and neural networks. These strategies were trained in two settings:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Moran process which is an evolutionary model of invasion and
    resistance across time during which high performing individuals are more
    likely to be replicated.
    \item A standard tournament
\end{itemize}

The results of~\cite{Knight2017} were confirmed in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:meta_tournaments}. The trained strategies performed at
the top of the standard tournament surpassing well established
strategies such as Tit For Tat, Pavlov, Gradual and zero determinant strategies.
In~\cite{Harper2017} it was observed that the trained strategies (with no manual
input) evolved the ability to have a handshake, to recognise themselves. This
was particularly important in a Moran process of resisting invasion where a
single individual of another type is introduced and the strategies need to
resist the invasion.

Another undertaken project included exploring rhino poaching behaviour using
evolutionary game theory~\cite{Glynatsi2018}. Rhino populations are at critical
level today and in protected areas devaluation approaches are used to secure the
life of the animals. The effectiveness of these approaches, however, relies on
poachers behaviour as they can be selective and not kill devalued rhinos or
indiscriminate. Populations of differently behaving poachers were modelled using
evolutionary game theory, and the results
demonstrated that full devaluation of all rhinos is likely to lead to
indiscriminate poaching and that devaluating of rhinos can only be effective
when implemented along with a strong disincentive framework. The paper aimed to
contribute to the necessary research required for an informed discussion about
the lively debate on legalising rhino horn trade.

Finally, providing science outreach workshops is a great way to gain a deeper
understanding of science and its applications, and enhancing students interest
in science. With that in mind an open source educational tutorial, called Game
Theory and Python~\cite{Glynatsi2017_game}, aimed at introducing participants to
game theory and more specifically to repeated games was created. The tutorial is
aimed at two groups of individuals, familiar with Python (programmers) who want
to start to learn game theory, mathematicians with little or no programming
knowledge as a pathway to programming through the interesting subject. The
tutorial has gained much interest and is currently under submission at the
Journal of Open Source Education.

\section{Future research directions}

Each part of this thesis has given rise to further interesting questions and
research directions that, although not in the scope of the current work, would
improve or compliment it.

\textbf{Future research - Meta tournament Analysis}

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:meta_tournaments} during the data collection the
probability of noise was allowed to vary between values of \(0\) and \(1\).
However, it was established that large values of noise (\(>
0.1\)) caused an impactful variation to the environment. From the collection of
\numberofstrategies strategies considered in the Chapter there was not a single
strategy that performed well in that spectrum of noise.

Strategies that have been trained specifically for noisy environments such
as DBS, Evolved FSM 16 Noise 05, Evolved ANN 5 Noise 05, PSO Gambler 2 2 2 Noise 05
and Omega Tit For Tat, performed adequately only in tournaments with restricted
noise. This indicates that possibly there is not a strategy in the literature
trained to be effective for a broad spectrum of noise values. Training such
strategy would be an interesting avenue of further research. The analysis of the
top performances would then be reproduced whilst including the new trained strategy.

\textbf{Future research - Memory-one strategies}

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:memory_one} the empirical results supported that
extortionate play is not always optimal and that memory-one strategies suffer
from their limited memory in multi agent interactions. All the empirical results
presented have been for the case of two opponents (\(N=2\)). A strictly value of \(N=2\) was
considered due to computational efficiency. However, in the Iterate Prisoner's
Dilemma multi agent interactions commonly include more than two strategies. A
future research would be to validate the empirical results of the Chapter for
larger values of \(N\).

Another restricted set of strategies on memory that have been studied in the literature
are memory-two strategies. These are strategies that take into account the past
two turns of the match. A compelling research question that arises is whether
the current formulation of Chapter~\ref{chapter:memory_one} can be expanded to
include memory-two strategies, and whether the results still hold. Moreover,
it would be aimed to generalised the results to memory-\(n\) strategies.

\textbf{Future research - Training an LSTM strategy}

%TODO based on the conclusions of the Chapter.
