This thesis summarises, evaluates and builds upon previous literature to push
the bounds of our understanding of how mathematical modelling and computer
science techniques can be used to find dominant behaviour. To summarise,
this thesis contributes to the discussion of dominant behaviour and provides new
mathematical results for the continued understanding of the questions raised
throughout.

This introductory Chapter is set as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item section~\ref{section:introduction_prisoners_dilemma} introduces
    the Prisoner's Dilemma.
    \item section~\ref{section:introduction_brief_literature} covers a brief
    literature review.
    \item section~\ref{section:introduction_research_questions} formalises the research
    questions and sets out the structure of the thesis.
    \item section~\ref{section:introduction_software_development} presents the
    software development techniques used throughout the thesis.
\end{itemize}

\section{Prisoner's Dilemma}\label{section:introduction_prisoners_dilemma}

Game theory was formalised in 1944~\cite{VonNeumann1944} and is the study of
interactions as \textit{games}. A game is a model of interacting
decision makers refereed to as \textit{players}. Each player has a set of
possible \textit{actions}, and the game captures the interactions of the player's
actions by allowing each player's \textit{payoffs} to be dependant on the actions
of all players. More precisely, as given in~\cite{Osborne2004}, the formal
definition of a game is as follows,

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{game} consists of
\begin{itemize}
    \item a set of player
    \item for each player, a set of actions
    \item for each player, payoff functions mapping the set of all actions to a numerical value.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

One of the most well known games is the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) originally
described in~\cite{Flood1958}. The PD is a two player non-cooperative game which
illustrates aspects of political philosophy and morality; how selfishness will
lead to an `inefficiency' of the outcome even though selflessness can be
evolutionarily advantageous.

More specifically, in the PD each player has two actions, to either be selfless
and cooperate, denoted as (C), or to be selfish and defect, denoted as (D). Each
decision is made simultaneously and independently. Players' payoffs are
generally represented by (\ref{eq:pd_definition}). Both players receive a reward
for mutual cooperation, \(R\), and a payoff \(P\) for mutual defection. A player
that defects while the other cooperates receives a payoff of \(T\), whereas the
cooperator receives \(S\).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pd_definition}
    S_p =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        R & S  \\
        T & P
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
    S_q =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        R & T  \\
        S & P
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

It is assumed that two cooperating players do better than two defecting ones,
and thus, the payoff of two cooperating players \(R\) is
larger than the payoff of two defecting players \(P\). A player, however, has the
temptation to deviate, as that player will receive a higher payoff \(T\) than
that of mutual cooperation \(R\) whilst the cooperator's payoff \(S\) is smaller than
\(P\). In consequence, the payoffs are constrained by
Equation~(\ref{eq:constrain_one}).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:constrain_one}
    T > R > P > S
\end{equation}

A second constraint which ensures that a social dilemma arises: the sum
of the utilities to both players is best when they both cooperate,
Equation~(\ref{eq:constrain_two}).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:constrain_two}
    2R > T + S
\end{equation}

Another equivalent representation of the PD is the \textit{donation game}.
In the donation game each player can cooperate by providing a benefit \(b\) to
the other player at a cost \(c\) with \(0 < c < d\). Thus, \(T=b, R=b-c,S=c,
\text{and } P=0\). The representation of the donation game payoff matrix is
given by~(\ref{eq:the_pd_payoffs_with_cost}).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:the_pd_payoffs_with_cost}
    S_p =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        b - c & c\\
        b & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
    S_q =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        b - c & b  \\
        c & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

This thesis studies the PD as given by Equation~(\ref{eq:pd_definition}). There
are numerical experiments presented in the following Chapters. These have been
carried out using the following payoff values: \(R = 3, P = 1, T = 5\) and \(S =
0\), which are the values most commonly used in the
literature~\cite{Axelrod1984, Knight2017}.  % TODO Add more (I think this can be quite a lengthy list)

In non-cooperative games the players interact in order to achieve their best 
possible outcome. A \textit{best response strategy} is a strategy
that maximises the utility of a player given a known strategy of the other
player. A solution concept commonly used in game theory is the Nash equilibrium~\cite{Nash1951}
which is a pair of best response strategies at which neither of the players has
a reason to deviate.

In the PD due to constraint (\ref{eq:constrain_one}) it never benefits a player
to cooperate. A player that cooperates receives either a payoff of \(R\) or \(S\)
depending the action of the other player, whereas if a player defects they
receive either \(T\) or \(P\), and \(T > R\) and \(P > S\). Once both
players defect neither have a reason to change their decision. Thus, in the
PD mutual defection is a Nash equilibrium and defection is the
best response strategy.

The game can be studied in a manner where prior outcomes matter. The repeated
form of the game is called the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) and it differs
from the original concept of a PD because participants can learn about the
behavioural tendencies of their opponent. In the IPD defecting is no
longer necessarily the dominant action, and identifying a best response is not
always trivial.

\section{Literature Review}\label{section:introduction_brief_literature}

In the 1980's Robert Axelrod studied the best way of behaving in the IPD by
running a series of computer tournaments with two collections of
strategies~\cite{Axelrod1984}. These strategies were written/submitted by
researchers. Axelrod performed an evolutionary tournament~\cite{Axelrod1981} and
two round robin tournaments~\cite{Axelrod1980a, Axelrod1980b}. The strategy that
took over the population and won both tournaments was the strategy Tit For Tat.
Axerlod's results demonstrated the robustness of the strategy in those
environments and subsequently the robustness of reciprocal behaviour. These
results, however, did not consider the success of the strategy in other
environments. This became more evident as further competitions and mathematical
formulations introduced new dominant strategies. A
brief summary of selected works and their dominant strategies are given by
Table~\ref{table:tournament_refs}.

    respective environments. These strategies were either explicitly calculated,

    \label{table:tournament_refs}
\end{table}

More details on these works will be presented in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:literature_review}, and following
Chapters~\ref{chapter:literature_review} and~\ref{chapter:bibliometric_study}
it will become evident that the literature on the IPD is rich, and new
strategies and competitions are being published every year.
The question, however, still remains the same: what is the best way to
play the game?

\section{Research Questions \& Thesis Structure}\label{section:introduction_research_questions}

This thesis contains eight Chapters, which together attempt to answer three research
questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the optimal behaviour an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma strategy should adapt as a response to different
 environments?\label{research_question_one}
    \item What are the research topics in the field of the Prisoner's Dilemma?\label{research_question_two}
    \item Is the academic field of the Prisoner's Dilemma cooperative and is there
    influence between the authors?\label{research_question_three}
\end{enumerate}

There are two main part to the thesis. The initial part aims to answer research
questions~\ref{research_question_two} and~\ref{research_question_three}.
Chapter~\ref{chapter:literature_review} provides a condensed
literature review which summarises the already established results of the
literature. Chapter~\ref{chapter:literature_review} separates the reviewed manuscripts
under different research topics identified manually. To complement the manual
separation of articles under research topics,
Chapter~\ref{chapter:bibliometric_study} automatically partitions 2,420 IPD
articles using data mining, machine learning and  natural language processing. The data set of 2,420 articles' metadata has
been collected using a bespoke research software. The data set is further
analysed using network theoretic approaches to answer research question~\ref{research_question_three}.

The second part of the thesis aims to answer research
question~\ref{research_question_one}. There are four Chapters to this part which
explore optimal behaviour using original approaches. Namely,
Chapter~\ref{chapter:meta_tournaments} analyses a large data set of computer. % TODO Add the number of tournaments.
tournaments of distinct types and evaluates \numberofstrategies strategies'
performance. Chapter~\ref{chapter:memory_one} explores best response strategies
to environments of memory-one opponents and
Chapter~\ref{chapter:best_response_sequence} explores best response strategies
in the form of static sequences of moves to a collection of opponents. Finally
Chapter~\ref{chapter:lstm}, uses the data set of best response sequences
generated in Chapter~\ref{chapter:best_response_sequence} to train an IPD
strategy using a recurrent neural network.

The seven Chapters of the thesis and their role is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:structure_of_thesis}. An arrow between one Chapter and another
implies that the work described in one serves as motivation for the other.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]

    \includestandalone[width=\textwidth]{src/chapters/01/tex/thesis_structure}
    \caption{Structure of this thesis.}\label{fig:structure_of_thesis}
\end{figure}

A summary of each Chapter is given below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:introduction} has contextualised the three main
    research questions of this thesis. Background of game theory and the
    Prisoner's Dilemma has been given, and the structure
    of the remainder of the thesis outlined.
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:literature_review} provides a systematic
    literature review for the Prisoner's Dilemma and a manual classification of
    the reviewed papers under research topics. The manually identified research
    topics include evolutionary dynamics, intelligently designed strategies
    and structured strategies and training.
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:bibliometric_study} presents a bibliometric
    analysis of 2,420 Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma articles. It uses natural language processing to. % TODO Remove the hard coded number of articles?
    identify five research topics, and a graph theoretic approach to quantify the
    collaborativeness of the field. The five identified topics are human subject
    research, biological studies, strategies, evolutionary dynamics on networks
    and modelling problems as a Prisoner's Dilemma.
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:meta_tournaments} generates and analyses a large data set of. % TODO Add number
    computer tournaments. It evaluates \numberofstrategies strategies, many of
    which are well known strategies from the literature.
    It presents the top performing strategies and analyses their salient features.  % TODO Add a single sentence of the main finding
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:memory_one} explores best responses to a
    collection of memory-one strategies as a multidimensional non linear
    optimisation problem. It presents a closed form algebraic expression for the
    utility of a memory-one strategy against a given set of opponents, a
    compact method of identifying it's best response to that given set of
    opponents whilst having a theory of mind, and it introduces a well designed
    framework that allows the comparison of an optimal memory-one strategy and a
    more complex strategy which has a larger memory.  % TODO Add a single sentence of the main finding, something like: its add to the literature questioning the importance of memory and adaptability in the IPD.
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:best_response_sequence} explores the problem of
    Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma best responses in the form of sequences.
    It heuristically identifies the best response sequence against 197 strategies,
    and generates a data set of 751 best response sequences of 205 turns. This chapter mainly serves as a foundation for Chapter~\ref{chapter:lstm} but does present a novel heuristic and a study of its performance.
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:lstm} uses the data set of best response strategies
    obtained from Chapter~\ref{chapter:best_response_sequence} to train a recurrent
    neural network to play the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.
    \item Chapter~\ref{chapter:conclusion} summarises the work of the previous
    six chapters, and indicates possible directions of future work, identifying
    further research questions that have arisen.
\end{itemize}

Chapters~\ref{chapter:meta_tournaments}-\ref{chapter:lstm} explore optimal the
behaviour in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. The disparity between the
approaches is their depth, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:depth_structure}.
Chapter~\ref{chapter:meta_tournaments} explores optimal behaviour
by analysing a data set of tournaments and evaluating the performance of
pre-designed strategies. The exact opposite is done in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:best_response_sequence} whereas for a given set of two
memory-one opponents a best response strategy is calculated explicitly.
Similarly, a best responses sequence against a given opponent is calculated in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:best_response_sequence} but this is done using a heuristic
method. Finally, Chapter~\ref{chapter:lstm} uses a machine learning algorithm
to generate a optimal behaviour based on recurrent networks without any manual
input.

\section{Software Development \& Best Practices}\label{section:introduction_software_development}

A survey conducted by the Software Sustainability Institute at 15 Russell Group
Universities showed that 92\% of the researchers questioned use software
intensively in their work, and 70\% said that ``It would not be practical to
conduct my work without software''~\cite{ssi_blog}. Similarly, the research of
this thesis heavily relies on software. As with all research there is an
obligation to ensuring the correctness and reproducibility of the results and the
software decisions throughout this thesis have been driven by these
requirements.

For the research of each Chapter (excluding Chapters~\ref{chapter:literature_review}
and~\ref{chapter:conclusion}) source code and analysis code have been developed.
They have been made public via GitHub and they have one of the most flexible and
permissive licences, the MIT licence. All code of this work is written in Python, an open source
language. Essentially the code developed for the thesis is available for inspection,
testing, and modification which enables and encourages
greater understanding of the underlying methodology, increases model confidence,
and provides an extendable framework which can currently be used by others.

Two themes that arise as vital in research software development:
reproducibility and sustainability. To reassure the reproducibility and
sustainability of the software, and subsequently the research described in the
thesis, several methods of
\textit{best practice}~\cite{Aberdour2007, Benureau2018, Crick2014, Hong2015}
were considered and implemented during development. Namely:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Version control
    \item Virtual environments
    \item Automated testing
    % \item Documentation
\end{itemize}

These will be discussed in the following subsections.

\subsection{Version control}

\textit{Version control}, is a system which records all files that make up a
project (down to the line) over time, tracking their development. It also
provides the ability to recall previous versions of files. This type of system
is essential for ensuring reproducibility of scientific research~\cite{Sandve2013,
Wilson2014}.

A good version control system has the following features as stated in~\cite{Ruparelia2010}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Backup and restore: Files can be saved as they are edited and have the facility to
    jump to a previous version.
    \item Synchronisation: Source code files can be shared and users can update their
    codebase with the latest version.
    \item Undo changes: Changes made to the code can be undone by going back
    to a version that was committed in the past.
    \item Track changes: Messages are attacked to file changes in order to track the
    how and why the code evolved over time.
    \item Track ownership: File changes are tagged with the user's names who made
    the changes.
    \item Sandboxing: The ability to make temporary changes in an isolated area,
    called a sandbox, to test and try out code before it is checked in.
    \item Branching and merging: This is akin to a larger sandbox. Users can
    branch a copy of the code into a separate area and modify it in
    isolation (tracking changes separately). Later, the work can be merged back
    into the original codebase.
\end{itemize}

There are a number of popular tools for version control, these include Git~\cite{git},
Subversion~\cite{subversion}, and Mercurial~\cite{mercurial}. The version
control system chosen to carry out the software development here is Git.

There are several services that host git servers online and allow users to work
with Git publicly. These services are essential for reproducibility as they make
not only the source code for the computer programmes available online but also
the history of its development. Such services are GitHub~\cite{github},
SourceForge~\cite{sourceforge}, Gitlab~\cite{gitlab}, and BitBucket~\cite{bitbucket}.
Github is the chosen service for the thesis which integrates well with Git.

An important feature of GitHub is that it fosters collaboration between users.
It is a social service which allows users to comment and raise issues on each
other's repositories. Moreover, it encourages collaboration and code contributions
by other users through pull request features. An example of a pull request on
a GitHub repository is given by Figure~\ref{fig:pull_request_github}. In Figure~\ref{fig:pull_request_github}
it is shown how changes are tagged with a user and a short message describing
the alternations made to the codebase. It is also shown how GitHub issues can be
addressed, and subsequently close from a specific pull request.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{src/chapters/01/img/GitHub_discussion}
    \caption{An example of a pull request on GitHub.}\label{fig:pull_request_github}
\end{figure}

The code for Chapters'~\ref{chapter:bibliometric_study}-\ref{chapter:lstm} is
hosted on individual GitHub repositories,
Table~\ref{table:source_code_data_citations}. The source code for each
repository has been packaged and has been archived on Zenodo~\cite{zenodo}.  % TODO Add a sentence or two here saying what/why archive?

\subsection{Virtual environments}

The source code of each repository has Python libraries as dependencies. Though
several of these projects use the same libraries, the versions of these
libraries can differ. Tracking software dependencies is of paramount importance
in order to ensure the reproducibility of computer code.

There are several tools for keeping dependencies required by different projects
separated. The tool used here are Python \textit{virtual environments}. More
specifically, the Anaconda virtual environments which integrate easily with the
programming language Python. Anaconda~\cite{anaconda} is a free and open-source distribution of
the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to
simplify package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the
package management system conda.

The Anaconda
 distribution manager: conda allows users to create, export, list, remove, and update environments that
have different versions of Python and/or packages installed in them. Switching
or moving between environments is called activating the environment. An environment
can be shared and kept under version control as a file. An example of
such as file is given by Figure~\ref{fig:environment_file}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{shell}
name: opt-mo
channels:
  - defaults

  - python=3.6.7

  - pandas=0.23.4

    - pytest==4.0.1
    - pytest-cov==2.7.1

    - fsspec==0.3.3
\end{shell}
\caption{An example of an environment file. The name of the specific environment is called
\mintinline{shell}{opt-mo} and it corresponds to the environment associated with
Chapter~\ref{chapter:memory_one}.}\label{fig:environment_file}
\end{figure}

Each chapter of the thesis includes an environment file detailing the dependencies
of the source code and their versions.

\subsection{Automated testing}

Testing code is of considerable importance in order to ensure the robustness,
correctness and sustainability of the computer code. The standard method of testing code is through
\textit{automated testing} using test suits that run parts of the code and
assert whether they are behaving as expected.

Two types of tests are described in~\cite{Percival2014}, \textit{functional
tests} that assert the code's functionality, and \textit{unit tests} that help
ensure the code is clean and free of bugs.

Functional tests aim to test how the whole application functions from the
perspective of the outside user. They feed in basic input and test whether the
end product/final behaviour is as expected. Unit tests assert that small chunks
of code behave as expected, and the test the application from the point of the
programmer. Unit tests are isolated from the rest of the code and are modular.
There are two types of unit tests: \textit{pure} and \textit{integrated} tests.

Pure unit tests are written to test only one function or method. Thus, if a pure
unit test was to fail then it should be due to problems with the specific part
of the code it is testing only, and not any other bit of code. Pure unit tests
are fast and readable, however they do not test how well functions and methods
integrate with one another. In order to test these, unit tests must be written
that rely on other parts of the code that are not explicitly being tested. This
type of test is called integrated tests.

The automated tests, which include functional and unit tests, of the
repositories associated with the thesis have been implemented using the Python
library \mintinline{python}{pytest}. The \mintinline{shell}{pytest} framework
makes it easy to write automated tests in a few lines. A plugin to
\mintinline{shell}{pytest} is that of \mintinline{shell}{pytest-cov}. The plugin
allows for coverage checks, to test how much of the code is covered by the testing
suite.  % TODO Add a sentence describing what "is covered" means

To regularly test code which aims to be merged back into the original codebase
continuous integration (CI) systems are used. CIs perform the tests suite and
the coverage check every time a new version of the codebase is made available
(``pushed'') on GitHub. The benefits of using a CI are identifying bugs quickly,
reducing problems when merging in contributions from collaborators, and adding
transparency to the development process. There are two CIs that have been used
in the repositories listed in Table~\ref{table:source_code_data_citations}.
These are Travis~\cite{travis} and GitHub Actions~\cite{github_actions}.

% \subsection{Documentation}

% Software \textit{documentation} is written text or illustration that accompanies
% computer software or is embedded in the source code. The documentation either
% explains how the software operates or how to use it.

% Each repository associated with the thesis includes a detailed README file.
% These contain installation instructions for corresponding packaged source code
% and demonstrate how to run the associated test suite. The source code for each
% repository has been written in a modular way and meaningful names have been
% given to all variables, functions, methods and classes. Each function, method
% and class includes a \text{docstring}. A docstring is a series of sentences used
% to document a specific segment of code.

% The repositories also include a series of Jupyter Notebooks~\cite{jupyter} that
% are used to carry out the analysis of each Chapter, and serve as demonstration
% of the source code's usage.

\subsection{Thesis's Code}

As previously stated the source code for
Chapters~\ref{chapter:bibliometric_study}-\ref{chapter:lstm} have been written
following best practices, have been packaged, are available on GitHub and have
been archived on Zenodo. These practices have been followed to reassure the the
correctness, reproducibility and sustainability of the source code and research
described throughout the thesis.

To ensure the reproducibility of the work the data sets used in several of
the following Chapters have also been archived and are available online. The details
for the source code and data sets for each Chapter are summarised in
Table~\ref{table:source_code_data_citations}.

\end{table}

Throughout the thesis, parts of the source code and examples of it's usage are
going to be presented in the corresponding Chapters.

The results of this thesis heavily rely not only on the projects of
Table~\ref{table:source_code_data_citations} but also on the open source package
Axelrod-Python library (APL). APL~\cite{axelrodproject} is an open source
project for simulating rounds of the IPD which contains a large collections of
strategies. APL has several capabilities which include performing different
types of tournaments. Its documentation is found at
\url{http://axelrod.readthedocs.io/}. The specific version of APL used at each
Chapter will be mentioned at the start of each Chapter.

This thesis itself is hosted on a GitHub repository at
\url{https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/Thesis}. It is written in the document
preparation system \LaTeX, and automated tests have been setup to tests
that the document compiles, spelling is correct, every time
an updated version of the document is pushed on GitHub.
